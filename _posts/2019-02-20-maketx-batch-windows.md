I recently developed this simple tool for the [AUGMENTED short film](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3855832/) team. We needed a tool to convert with one click one entire folder with EXR images into TX in order to load them in VRAY directly, so I designed this "Send To" workflow that is really quick and easy to use. Now if you like it you can also use it for free :)
