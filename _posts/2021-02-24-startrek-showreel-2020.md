Long time has passed [since my last post](/a-personal-space-opera) on this blog. Back then I talked about how working on a Star Wars show was sort of a dream come true. 

I've been working at [Ghost VFX](https://ghost.dk) almost two years now, I've been part of amazing projects all this time, and I would like to show you another *stars*. So there it is: **Star Trek Picard Season 01** and **Star Trek Discovery Season 03**, one short video with some of the shots and assets I helped bring to life. Hope you like it!

Carlos.
